        The Qualification tool analyzes Spark events generated from CPU based Spark applications to
        help quantify the expected acceleration and costs savings of migrating a Spark application
        or query to GPU. The wrapper downloads dependencies and executes the analysis on the local
        dev machine
        :param cpu_cluster: The on-premises cluster on which the Apache Spark applications were executed.
                Accepted value is valid path to the cluster properties file (json format).
        :param eventlogs: A comma separated list of urls pointing to event logs in local directory.
        :param local_folder: Local work-directory path to store the output and to be used as root
                directory for temporary folders/files. The final output will go into a subdirectory
                named `qual-${EXEC_ID}` where `exec_id` is an auto-generated unique identifier of the execution.
        :param tools_jar: Path to a bundled jar including RAPIDS tool. The path is a local filesystem path
        :param filter_apps:  Filtering criteria of the applications listed in the final STDOUT table is one of
                the following (`ALL`, `SPEEDUPS`). "`ALL`" means no filter applied. "`SPEEDUPS`" lists all the
                apps that are either '_Recommended_', or '_Strongly Recommended_' based on speedups.
        :param target_platform: Cost savings and speedup recommendation for comparable cluster in target_platform
                based on on-premises cluster configuration. Currently only `dataproc` is supported for
                target_platform.If not provided, the final report will be limited to GPU speedups only
                without cost-savings.
        :param gpu_cluster_recommendation: The type of GPU cluster recommendation to generate.
               It accepts one of the following ("CLUSTER", "JOB" and the default value "MATCH").
                "MATCH": keep GPU cluster same number of nodes as CPU cluster;
                "CLUSTER": recommend optimal GPU cluster by cost for entire cluster;
                "JOB": recommend optimal GPU cluster by cost per job
        :param jvm_heap_size: The maximum heap size of the JVM in gigabytes
        :param verbose: True or False to enable verbosity to the wrapper script
        :param cpu_discount: A percent discount for the cpu cluster cost in the form of an integer value
                (e.g. 30 for 30% discount).
        :param gpu_discount: A percent discount for the gpu cluster cost in the form of an integer value
                (e.g. 30 for 30% discount).
        :param global_discount: A percent discount for both the cpu and gpu cluster costs in the form of an
                integer value (e.g. 30 for 30% discount).
        :param rapids_options: A list of valid Qualification tool options.

                multiple "spark-property" arguments.
