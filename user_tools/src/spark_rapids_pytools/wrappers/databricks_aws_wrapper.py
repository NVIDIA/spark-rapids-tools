        Diagnostic tool to collect information from Databricks cluster, such as OS version, # of worker nodes,
        Yarn configuration, Spark version and error logs etc. Please note, some sensitive information might
        be collected by this tool, e.g. access secret configured in configuration files or dumped to log files.
        :param cluster: ID of the Databricks cluster running an accelerated computing instance.
        :param profile: A named Databricks profile to get the settings/credentials of the Databricks CLI.
        :param aws_profile: A named AWS profile to get the settings/credentials of the AWS account.
        :param output_folder: Local path where the archived result will be saved.
               Note that this argument only accepts local filesystem. If the argument is NONE,
               the default value is the env variable "RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" if any;

               "~/.databrickscfg" on Unix, Linux, or macOS.
        :param port: Port number to be used for the ssh connections.
        :param key_file: Path to the private key file to be used for the ssh connections.
        :param thread_num: Number of threads to access remote cluster nodes in parallel. The valid value
               is 1~10. The default value is 3.
        :param yes: auto confirm to interactive question.
