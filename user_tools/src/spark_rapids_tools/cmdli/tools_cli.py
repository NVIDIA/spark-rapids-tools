        Spark applications to GPU accelerated clusters.

        The Qualification cmd analyzes Spark eventlogs generated from  CPU based Spark applications to
        help quantify the expected acceleration and costs savings of migrating a Spark application or
        query to GPU.
        The cmd will process each app individually, but will group apps with the same name into the
        same output row after averaging duration metrics accordingly.

                (comma separated).

                Skipping this argument requires that the cluster argument points to a valid
                cluster name on the CSP.

                Note that this filter does not affect the CSV report.
                "ALL" means no filter applied. "SPEEDUPS" lists all the apps that are either
                'Recommended', or 'Strongly Recommended' based on speedups. "SAVINGS"
                lists all the apps that have positive estimated GPU savings except for the apps that
                are "Not Applicable"
