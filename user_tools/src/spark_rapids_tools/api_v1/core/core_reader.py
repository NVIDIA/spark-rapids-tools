    Base class for core report readers. It provides common functionality
    for reading core reports and loading application descriptions.
    Typically, a core reader has some more specific functionalities and capabilities. For example,
    1. the core-reader has the reponsibility to list all the AppHandlers that were analyzed by the run.
    The reason we use a core-reader instead of a wrapper reader is that the core-reader has the
    actual list of eventlogs. So, it can be used to define all the eventlogPaths and and categorize
    them into their perspective results.
    2. The core reader can define the version of the core-tools that generated the output results
    and whether it is compatible
