# RAPIDS User Tools on Dataproc GKE

This is a guide for the RAPIDS tools for Apache Spark on [Google Cloud Dataproc GKE](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/dpgke/dataproc-gke-overview).  
At the end of this guide, the user will be able to run the RAPIDS tools to analyze the clusters and
the applications running on _Google Cloud Dataproc GKE_.


## Prerequisites

### 1.gcloud CLI

- Install the gcloud CLI. Follow the instructions on [gcloud-sdk-install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- Set the configuration settings and credentials of the gcloud CLI:
  - Initialize the gcloud CLI by following [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing#initialize_the)
  - Grant authorization to the gcloud CLI [with a user account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorize_with_a_user_account)
  - Set up application default credentials to the gcloud CLI [by logging in](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#set_up_application_default_credentials)
  - Manage gcloud CLI configurations. For more details, visit [gcloud-sdk-configurations](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations)
  - Verify that the following [gcloud CLI properties](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties) are properly defined:
    - `dataproc/region`,
    - `compute/zone`,
    - `compute/region`
    - `core/project`

### 2.RAPIDS tools

- Spark event logs:
    - The RAPIDS tools can process Apache Spark CPU event logs from Spark 2.0 or higher (raw, .lz4, .lzf, .snappy, .zstd)
    - For `qualification` commands, the event logs need to be archived to an accessible gs folder.

### 3.Install the package

- Install `spark-rapids-user-tools` with python [3.8, 3.10] using:
    - pip:  `pip install spark-rapids-user-tools`
    - wheel-file: `pip install <wheel-file>`
    - from source: `pip install -e .`
- verify the command is installed correctly by running
  ```bash
    spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc-gke -- --help
  ```

### 4.Environment variables

Before running any command, you can set environment variables to specify configurations.
RAPIDS variables have a naming pattern `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_*`:
  - `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_CACHE_FOLDER`: specifies the location of a local directory that the RAPIDS-cli uses to
    store and cache the downloaded resources. The default is `/var/tmp/spark_rapids_user_tools_cache`.  
    Note that caching the resources locally has an impact on the total execution time of the command.
  - `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: specifies the location of a local directory that the RAPIDS-cli uses to
    generate the output. The wrapper CLI arguments override that environment variable
    (`--output_folder` and `local_folder` for Bootstrap and Qualification respectively).
  
## Qualification command

### Local deployment

```
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc-gke qualification [options]
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc-gke qualification -- --help
```

The local deployment runs on the local development machine. It requires:
1. Installing and configuring the gcloud CLI (`gsutil` and `gcloud` commands)
2. Java 1.8+ development environment
3. Internet access to download JAR dependencies from mvn: `spark-*.jar`, and `gcs-connector-hadoop-*.jar`
4. Dependencies are cached on the local disk to reduce the overhead of the download.

#### Use case scenario

A typical workflow to successfully run the `qualification` command in local mode is described as follows:

1. Store the Apache Spark event logs in gs folder.
2. A user sets up his development machine:
    1. configures Java
    2. installs gcloud CLI and configures the profile and the credentials to make sure the gcloud CLI
       commands can access the gs resources `LOGS_BUCKET`.
    3. installs `spark_rapids_user_tools`
3. If the results of the wrapper need to be stored on gs, then another gs uri is required `REMOTE_FOLDER=gs://OUT_BUCKET/`
4. User defines the virtual Dataproc-cluster on which the Spark application were running. Note that the cluster needs to be
   active; Dataproc on GKE cannot be present in `STOPPED` state. It has to be visible by the gcloud CLI (i.e., can run `gcloud dataproc clusters describe
   cluster_name`).
5. The following script runs qualification by passing gs remote directory to store the output:

   ```
   # define the wrapper cache directory if necessary
   export RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_CACHE_FOLDER=my_cache_folder
   export EVENTLOGS=gs://LOGS_BUCKET/eventlogs/
   export CLUSTER_NAME=my-virtual-dataproc-cpu-cluster
   export REMOTE_FOLDER=gs://OUT_BUCKET/wrapper_output
   
   spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc-gke qualification \
      --eventlogs $EVENTLOGS \
      --cpu_cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
      --remote_folder $REMOTE_FOLDER
   ```
   The wrapper generates a unique-Id for each execution in the format of `qual_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>`
   The above command will generate a directory containing `qualification_summary.csv` in addition to
   the actual folder of the RAPIDS Qualification tool. The directory will be mirrored to gs path (`REMOTE_FOLDER`).

   ```
    ./qual_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>/qualification_summary.csv
    ./qual_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>/rapids_4_spark_qualification_output/
   ```

### Qualification output

For each app, the command output lists the following fields:

- `App ID`: An application is referenced by its application ID, '_app-id_'. When running on YARN,
  each application may have multiple attempts, but there are attempt IDs only for applications
  in cluster mode, not applications in client mode.  Applications in YARN cluster mode can be
  identified by their attempt-id.
- `App Name`: Name of the application
- `Speedup Based Recommendation`: Recommendation based on '_Estimated Speed-up Factor_'. Note that an
  application that has job or stage failures will be labeled '_Not Applicable_'
- `Savings Based Recommendation`: Recommendation based on '_Estimated GPU Savings_'.
    - '_Strongly Recommended_': An app with savings GEQ 40%
    - '_Recommended_': An app with savings between (1, 40) %
    - '_Not Recommended_': An app with no savings
    - '_Not Applicable_': An app that has job or stage failures.
- `Estimated GPU Speedup`: Speed-up factor estimated for the app. Calculated as the ratio
  between '_App Duration_' and '_Estimated GPU Duration_'.
- `Estimated GPU Duration`: Predicted runtime of the app if it was run on GPU
- `App Duration`: Wall-Clock time measured since the application starts till it is completed.
  If an app is not completed an estimated completion time would be computed.
- `Estimated GPU Savings(%)`: Percentage of cost savings of the app if it migrates to an
  accelerated cluster. It is calculated as:
  ```
  estimated_saving = 100 - ((100 * gpu_cost) / cpu_cost)

The command creates a directory with UUID that contains the following:
- Directory generated by the RAPIDS qualification tool `rapids_4_spark_qualification_output`;
- A CSV file that contains the summary of all the applications along with estimated absolute costs
- Sample directory structure:
    ```

    ```

#### TCO calculator

In the `qualification_summary.csv` output file, you will see two additional columns appended:
`Estimated Job Frequency (monthly)` and `Annual Cost Savings`.  
These new columns are to be used as part of a TCO calculator to see the long-term benefit of using
Spark RAPIDS with your applications.
