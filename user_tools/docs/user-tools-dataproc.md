# RAPIDS User Tools on Dataproc

This is a guide for the RAPIDS tools for Apache Spark on [Google Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc).  
At the end of this guide, the user will be able to run the RAPIDS tools to analyze the clusters and
the applications running on _Google Cloud Dataproc_.


## Prerequisites

### 1.gcloud CLI

- Install the gcloud CLI. Follow the instructions on [gcloud-sdk-install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- Set the configuration settings and credentials of the gcloud CLI:
  - Initialize the gcloud CLI by following [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing#initialize_the)
  - Grant authorization to the gcloud CLI [with a user account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorize_with_a_user_account)
  - Set up application default credentials to the gcloud CLI [by logging in](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#set_up_application_default_credentials)
  - Manage gcloud CLI configurations. For more details, visit [gcloud-sdk-configurations](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations)
  - Verify that the following [gcloud CLI properties](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties) are properly defined:
    - `dataproc/region`,
    - `compute/zone`,
    - `compute/region`
    - `core/project`

### 2.RAPIDS tools

- Spark event logs:
    - The RAPIDS tools can process Apache Spark CPU event logs from Spark 2.0 or higher (raw, .lz4, .lzf, .snappy, .zstd)
    - For `qualification`/`profiling` commands, the event logs need to be archived to an accessible gs folder.

### 3.Install the package

- Install `spark-rapids-user-tools` with python [3.8, 3.10] using:
    - pip:  `pip install spark-rapids-user-tools`
    - wheel-file: `pip install <wheel-file>`
    - from source: `pip install -e .`
- verify the command is installed correctly by running
  ```bash
    spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc --help
  ```

### 4.Environment variables

Before running any command, you can set environment variables to specify configurations.
RAPIDS variables have a naming pattern `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_*`:
  - `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_CACHE_FOLDER`: specifies the location of a local directory that the RAPIDS-cli uses to
    store and cache the downloaded resources. The default is `/var/tmp/spark_rapids_user_tools_cache`.  
    Note that caching the resources locally has an impact on the total execution time of the command.
  - `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: specifies the location of a local directory that the RAPIDS-cli uses to
    generate the output. The wrapper CLI arguments override that environment variable
    (`--output_folder` and `local_folder` for Bootstrap and Qualification respectively).
  
## Qualification command

### Local deployment

```
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc qualification [options]
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc qualification --help
```

The local deployment runs on the local development machine. It requires:
1. Installing and configuring the gcloud CLI (`gsutil` and `gcloud` commands)
2. Java 1.8+ development environment
3. Internet access to download JAR dependencies from mvn: `spark-*.jar`, and `gcs-connector-hadoop-*.jar`
4. Dependencies are cached on the local disk to reduce the overhead of the download.

#### Use case scenario

A typical workflow to successfully run the `qualification` command in local mode is described as follows:

1. Store the Apache Spark event logs in gs folder.
2. A user sets up his development machine:
    1. configures Java
    2. installs gcloud CLI and configures the profile and the credentials to make sure the gcloud CLI
       commands can access the gs resources `LOGS_BUCKET`.
    3. installs `spark_rapids_user_tools`
3. If the results of the wrapper need to be stored on gs, then another gs uri is required `REMOTE_FOLDER=gs://OUT_BUCKET/`
4. User defines the Dataproc-cluster on which the Spark application were running. Note that the cluster does not have to be
   active; but it has to be visible by the gcloud CLI (i.e., can run `gcloud dataproc clusters describe
   cluster_name`).
5. The following script runs qualification by passing gs remote directory to store the output:

   ```
   # define the wrapper cache directory if necessary
   export RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_CACHE_FOLDER=my_cache_folder
   export EVENTLOGS=gs://LOGS_BUCKET/eventlogs/
   export CLUSTER_NAME=my-dataproc-cpu-cluster
   export REMOTE_FOLDER=gs://OUT_BUCKET/wrapper_output
   
   spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc qualification \
      --eventlogs $EVENTLOGS \
      --cpu_cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
      --remote_folder $REMOTE_FOLDER
   ```
   The wrapper generates a unique-Id for each execution in the format of `qual_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>`
   The above command will generate a directory containing `qualification_summary.csv` in addition to
   the actual folder of the RAPIDS Qualification tool. The directory will be mirrored to gs path (`REMOTE_FOLDER`).

   ```
    ./qual_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>/qualification_summary.csv
    ./qual_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>/rapids_4_spark_qualification_output/
   ```

### Qualification output

For each app, the command output lists the following fields:

- `App ID`: An application is referenced by its application ID, '_app-id_'. When running on YARN,
  each application may have multiple attempts, but there are attempt IDs only for applications
  in cluster mode, not applications in client mode.  Applications in YARN cluster mode can be
  identified by their attempt-id.
- `App Name`: Name of the application
- `Speedup Based Recommendation`: Recommendation based on '_Estimated Speed-up Factor_'. Note that an
  application that has job or stage failures will be labeled '_Not Applicable_'
- `Savings Based Recommendation`: Recommendation based on '_Estimated GPU Savings_'.
    - '_Strongly Recommended_': An app with savings GEQ 40%
    - '_Recommended_': An app with savings between (1, 40) %
    - '_Not Recommended_': An app with no savings
    - '_Not Applicable_': An app that has job or stage failures.
- `Estimated GPU Speedup`: Speed-up factor estimated for the app. Calculated as the ratio
  between '_App Duration_' and '_Estimated GPU Duration_'.
- `Estimated GPU Duration`: Predicted runtime of the app if it was run on GPU
- `App Duration`: Wall-Clock time measured since the application starts till it is completed.
  If an app is not completed an estimated completion time would be computed.
- `Estimated GPU Savings(%)`: Percentage of cost savings of the app if it migrates to an
  accelerated cluster. It is calculated as:
  ```
  estimated_saving = 100 - ((100 * gpu_cost) / cpu_cost)

The command creates a directory with UUID that contains the following:
- Directory generated by the RAPIDS qualification tool `rapids_4_spark_qualification_output`;
- A CSV file that contains the summary of all the applications along with estimated absolute costs
- Sample directory structure:

#### TCO calculator

In the `qualification_summary.csv` output file, you will see two additional columns appended:
`Estimated Job Frequency (monthly)` and `Annual Cost Savings`.  
These new columns are to be used as part of a TCO calculator to see the long-term benefit of using
Spark RAPIDS with your applications.  
A GSheet template with instructions can be found at here: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CslQHTwxHEDTlAP4lcrOzbSrmucvn8z4iFlJo6EAhxs/edit#gid=1607726286).

### Cluster deployment

This deployment option allows running the RAPIDS tools on an active Dataproc cluster that is
running a Spark-3.x+.  
This option offers the scalability in handling large pool of event logs.

The Cluster-deployment mode is similar to the [Local-deployment](#local-deployment) except that the CLI
takes a new argument `execution_cluster` which is the name of the Dataproc cluster on which the tool is
intended to run.

```
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc qualification --execution_cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> [options]
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc qualification --help
```

## Profiling command

### Local deployment

```
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc profiling [options]
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc profiling --help
```

The local deployment runs on the local development machine. It requires:
1. Installing and configuring the gcloud CLI (`gsutil` and `gcloud` commands)
2. Java 1.8+ development environment
3. Internet access to download JAR dependencies from mvn: `spark-*.jar`, and `gcs-connector-hadoop-*.jar`
4. Dependencies are cached on the local disk to reduce the overhead of the download.

If the CLI does not provide an argument `gpu_cluster`, then a valid path to yaml file must be
provided through the arg `worker_info`.  
The `worker_info` is a yaml file that contains the HW description of the workers. It must contain
the following properties:
- `system.numCores`: number of cores of a single worker node
- `system.memory`: RAM size in MiB of a single node
- `system.numWorkers`: number of workers
- `gpu.name`: the accelerator installed on the worker node
- `gpu.memory`: memory size of the accelerator in MiB. (i.e., 16GB for Nvidia-T4)
- `softwareProperties`: Spark default-configurations of the target cluster

An example of valid `worker_info.yaml`:

  ```
  system:
    numCores: 32
    memory: 212992MiB
    numWorkers: 5
  gpu:
    memory: 15109MiB
    count: 4
    name: T4
  softwareProperties:
    spark.driver.maxResultSize: 7680m
    spark.driver.memory: 15360m
    spark.executor.cores: '8'
    spark.executor.instances: '2'
    spark.executor.memory: 47222m
    spark.executorEnv.OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS: '1'
    spark.scheduler.mode: FAIR
    spark.sql.cbo.enabled: 'true'
    spark.ui.port: '0'
    spark.yarn.am.memory: 640m
  ```

#### Use case scenario

A typical workflow to successfully run the `profiling` command in local mode is described as follows:

1. Store the Apache Spark event logs (gs bucket, or local folder).
2. A user sets up his development machine:
    1. configures Java
    2. installs gcloud CLI and configures the profile and the credentials to make sure the gcloud CLI
       commands can access the gs resources `LOGS_BUCKET`.
    3. installs `spark_rapids_user_tools`
3. If the results of the wrapper need to be stored on gs, then another gs uri is required `REMOTE_FOLDER=gs://OUT_BUCKET/`
4. Depending on the accessibility of the cluster properties, the user chooses one of the 2
   cases below (_"Case-A"_, and _"Case-B"_) to trigger the CLI.

For each successful execution, the wrapper generates a new directory in the format of
`prof_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>`. The directory contains `profiling_summary.log` in addition to
the actual folder of the RAPIDS Profiling tool. The directory will be mirrored to gs folder if the
argument `--remote_folder` was a valid gs path.

   ```
    ./prof_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>/profiling_summary.log
    ./prof_<YYYYmmddHHmmss>_<0x%08X>/rapids_4_spark_profile/
   ```

**Case-A: A gpu-cluster property file is accessible:**

A cluster property is still accessible if one of the following conditions applies:

1. The cluster is listed by the `gcloud` cmd. In this case, the CLI will be triggered by providing
   `--gpu_cluster CLUSTER_NAME`

       ```
       # run the command using the GPU cluster name
       export RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_CACHE_FOLDER=my_cache_folder
       export EVENTLOGS=gs://LOGS_BUCKET/eventlogs/
       export CLUSTER_NAME=my-dataproc-gpu-cluster
       export REMOTE_FOLDER=gs://OUT_BUCKET/wrapper_output
       
       spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc profiling \
          --eventlogs $EVENTLOGS \
          --gpu_cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
          --remote_folder $REMOTE_FOLDER
       ```
2. The cluster properties file is accessible on local disk or a valid gs path.

   ```
   $> export CLUSTER_PROPS_FILE=cluster-props.json
   $> gcloud dataproc clusters describe $CLUSTER_NAME --format json > $CLUSTER_PROPS_FILE
   ```
   Trigger the CLI by providing the path to the properties file `gpu_cluster $CLUSTER_PROPS_FILE`

   ```
   $> spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc profiling \
        --eventlogs $EVENTLOGS \
        --gpu_cluster $CLUSTER_PROPS_FILE \
        --remote_folder $REMOTE_FOLDER
   ```

**Case-B: GPU cluster information is missing:**

In this scenario, users can write down a simple yaml file to describe the shape of the worker nodes.  
This case is relevant to the following plans:
1. Users who might want to experiment with different configurations before deciding on the final
   cluster shape. 
2. Users who have no access to the properties of the cluster.

The CLI is triggered by providing the location where the yaml file is stored `--worker_info $WORKER_INFO_PATH`

    ```
    # First, create a yaml file as described in previous section
    $> export WORKER_INFO_PATH=worker-info.yaml
    # Run the profiling cmd
    $> spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc profiling \
            --eventlogs $EVENTLOGS \
            --worker_info $WORKER_INFO_PATH \
            --remote_folder $REMOTE_FOLDER
    ```

## Bootstrap command

```
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc bootstrap [options]
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc bootstrap --help
```

The command generates an output with a list of properties to be applied to Spark configurations.
In order to apply those recommendations, the cluster has to be running, and the user must have SSH
access.

### Bootstrap options

| Option            | Description                                                               | Default                                                                                     | Required |

| **output_folder** | Path to local directory where the final recommendations is logged         | env variable `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` if any; or the current working directory. |     N    |
| **dry_run**       | True or False to update the Spark config settings on Dataproc master node | True                                                                                        |     N    |
| **verbose**       | True or False to enable verbosity to the wrapper script                   | False if `RAPIDS_USER_TOOLS_LOG_DEBUG` is not set                                           |     N    |

### Dry-run enabled

The default is to enable dry-run. This generates recommendations without any side effect. This mode helps to generate
a map between cluster configuration and the recommended Spark properties.  
Note that this mode:
- does not require SSH access to the cluster
- does not require the cluster to be active and running.

1. User creates a cluster
2. Run the following command

    ```bash
    spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc bootstrap \
      --cluster my-cluster-name
    ```

### Dry-run disabled

In some cases, the user may want to run this command as part of the initialization scripts.  
The command update Sparks default-conf `/etc/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf` SSH access
to the active cluster.

The steps to run the command:

1. The user creates a cluster
2. The user runs the following command:

    ```bash
    spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc bootstrap \
      --cluster my-cluster-name \
      --nodry_run
    ```

If the connection to Dataproc instances cannot be established through SSH, the command will still
generate an output while displaying warning that the remote changes failed. 

## Diagnostic command

```
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc diagnostic [options]
spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc diagnostic --help
```

Run diagnostic command to collects information from Dataproc cluster, such as OS version, # of worker
nodes, Yarn configuration, Spark version and error logs etc. The cluster has to be running and the
user must have SSH access.

### Info collection

The default is to collect info from each cluster node via SSH access and an archive would be created
to output folder at last.

The steps to run the command:

1. The user creates a cluster
2. The user runs the following command:

    ```bash
    spark_rapids_user_tools dataproc diagnostic \
      --cluster my-cluster-name
    ```

If the connection to Dataproc instances cannot be established through SSH, the command will raise error.
