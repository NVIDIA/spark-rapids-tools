# Sample eventlogs

These eventlogs were produced by running the [NDS benchmarks](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-benchmarks) on both CPU and GPU versions of a Spark local cluster set up in an onprem environment. For simplicity, these are just copies of eventlogs used for training the qualx `onprem` model.
