Feature: HDFS Event Log Storage

  @test_id_HDFS_0001
  Scenario Outline: Eventlogs are stored in HDFS - Platform specified
    Given platform is "<platform>"
    And HDFS is "running"
    And HDFS has "<eventlog>" eventlogs
    When spark-rapids tool is executed with "hdfs:///<eventlog>" eventlogs
    Then processed applications is "1"
    And return code is "0"

    Examples:
      | platform | eventlog              |
      | onprem   | join_agg_on_yarn_eventlog.zstd |
      | dataproc | join_agg_on_yarn_eventlog.zstd |

  @test_id_HDFS_0002
  Scenario Outline: Eventlogs are stored in HDFS - Platform not specified
    Given HDFS is "running"
    And HDFS has "<eventlog>" eventlogs
    When spark-rapids tool is executed with "hdfs:///<eventlog>" eventlogs
    Then processed applications is "1"
    And return code is "0"

    Examples:
      | eventlog              |
      | join_agg_on_yarn_eventlog.zstd |

  @test_id_HDFS_0003
  Scenario Outline: Eventlogs are stored in HDFS - HDFS installed but not running
    Given HDFS is "not running"
    When spark-rapids tool is executed with "hdfs:///<eventlog>" eventlogs
    Then stderr contains the following
      """
      EventLogPathProcessor: Unexpected exception occurred reading hdfs:///<eventlog>, skipping!
      """
    And processed applications is "0"
    And return code is "0"

    Examples:
      | eventlog              |
      | join_agg_on_yarn_eventlog.zstd |

  @test_id_HDFS_0004
  Scenario Outline: Eventlogs are stored in HDFS - HDFS not installed, Platform specified
    Given platform is "onprem"
    And HDFS is "not installed"
    When spark-rapids tool is executed with "hdfs:///<eventlog>" eventlogs
    Then stderr contains the following
      """
      EventLogPathProcessor: Unexpected exception occurred reading hdfs:///<eventlog>, skipping!;Incomplete HDFS URI
      """
    And processed applications is "0"
    And return code is "0"

    Examples:
      | eventlog              |
      | join_agg_on_yarn_eventlog.zstd |

  @test_id_HDFS_0005
  Scenario Outline: Eventlogs are stored in HDFS - HDFS not installed, Platform not specified
    Given HDFS is "not installed"
    When spark-rapids tool is executed with "hdfs:///<eventlog>" eventlogs
    Then stderr contains the following
      """
      EventLogPathProcessor: Unexpected exception occurred reading hdfs:///<eventlog>, skipping!;Incomplete HDFS URI
      """
    And processed applications is "0"
    And return code is "0"
