Feature: Event Log Processing

  @test_id_ELP_0001
  Scenario Outline: Tool spark_rapids runs with different types of event logs
    When spark-rapids tool is executed with "<event_logs>" eventlogs
    Then stderr contains the following
      """
      <expected_stderr>
      """
    And processed applications is "0"
    And return code is "0"

    Examples:
      | event_logs                         | expected_stderr                                                                                                       |
      | invalid_path_eventlog              | process.failure.count = 1;invalid_path_eventlog not found, skipping!                                                  |
      | gpu_eventlog.zstd                  | process.skipped.count = 1;GpuEventLogException: Cannot parse event logs from GPU run: skipping this file              |
      | photon_eventlog.zstd               | process.skipped.count = 1;PhotonEventLogException: Encountered Databricks Photon event log: skipping this file!       |
      | streaming_eventlog.zstd            | process.skipped.count = 1;StreamingEventLogException: Encountered Spark Structured Streaming Job: skipping this file! |
      | incorrect_app_status_eventlog.zstd | process.NA.count = 1;IncorrectAppStatusException: Application status is incorrect. Missing AppInfo                    |
