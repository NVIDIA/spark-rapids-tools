# Defines the example target cluster information with custom systemMemoryFraction.
# Usage: `<JAVA CMD> --platform dataproc --target-cluster-info <path to this file>`
#
# systemMemoryFraction: Optional fraction of system memory available for executor use.
# If not set, the platform default will be used (e.g., 0.8 for Dataproc, 0.7 for EMR).
# This accounts for memory reserved by resource managers like YARN.
# Use this to override the default when your environment has different memory reservations.
