# Defines the example target cluster information with tuningDefinitions support to be used by the Profiling Tool.
# Usage: `<JAVA CMD> --platform onprem --target-cluster-info <path to this file>`
#
# This example demonstrates how to use the "preserve" and "exclude" lists to control which Spark properties
# are preserved from the source cluster and which are excluded from AutoTuner's recommendations.
