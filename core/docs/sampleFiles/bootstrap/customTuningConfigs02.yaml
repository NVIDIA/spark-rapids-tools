# Example custom tuning configuration file for use with the Tools AutoTuner and Bootstrap.
# This file demonstrates the case to override the plugin behavior by disabling a specific rule.
# In this example, the "DeltaOSSWriteRule" from the "deltaLakeOSSTuningPlugin" is disabled,
# which prevents the AutoTuner from appending comments related to the RAPIDS Accelerator
# writes on Delta Lake tables.
#
# Notes:
# - Default values for all configuration parameters are available in `tuningConfigs.yaml`.
# - Custom configurations only need to specify parameters that need to be changed from the defaults.
# - It is unnecessary to include fields that are not intended to be changed.
#
# Usage: To use a custom tuning configuration, specify the file with:
# - `--tuning-configs /path/to/custom/file.YAML` when running the Tools JAR
# - `--tuning_configs /path/to/custom/file.YAML` when running the Tools CLI
