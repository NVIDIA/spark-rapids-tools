# Example custom tuning configuration file for use with the Tools AutoTuner and Bootstrap.
#
# Notes:
# - Default values for all configuration parameters are available in `tuningConfigs.yaml`.
# - Custom configurations only need to specify parameters that need to be changed from the defaults.
# - It is unnecessary to include description or usedBy fields; only name, default, min, and/or max as required.
#
# Usage: To use a custom tuning configuration, specify the file with:
# - `--tuning-configs /path/to/custom/file.YAML` when running the Tools JAR
# - `--tuning_configs /path/to/custom/file.YAML` when running the Tools CLI
default:
  - name: CONC_GPU_TASKS
