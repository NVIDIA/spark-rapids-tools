/**
 * Represents execution plan information for Databricks Photon engine nodes.
 *
 * Photon is Databricks' vectorized query engine that accelerates Spark workloads.
 * This class captures both the Photon-specific node information (e.g., "PhotonProject",
 * "PhotonHashAggregate") and the equivalent Spark node information for compatibility
 * and cross-platform analysis.
 *
 * @param actualName The Photon-specific node name (e.g., "PhotonProject")
 * @param actualDesc The Photon-specific description
 * @param sparkName  The equivalent Spark node name (e.g., "Project")
 * @param sparkDesc  The equivalent Spark description
 * @param children   Child execution plan nodes in the plan tree
 * @param metadata   Additional metadata associated with the Photon plan node
 * @param metrics    SQL metrics collected for this Photon plan node
