/**
 * A class to maintain the tasks.
 * There is an alternative design that consists of using StageModel as a parent holding a list of
 * tasks.
 * However, the decision to use a standalone TaskModelManager at the moment is to achieve the
 * following targets:
 * 1- separation between managing the Stages and their Tasks. It is known that Tasks represent the
 * highest percentage of allocated objects in the memory. This allows us to drop the entire tasks
 * management if we dice to aggregate the metrics through the Acccumulables list.
 * 2- flexibility in refactoring the TaskManager to use a permanent storage toward future
 * improvements.
