/**
 * A trait that defines a condition that can be evaluated against a target object.
 *
 * This trait provides a foundation for building composable, reusable conditions
 * that can be used in plugin activation logic, rule execution, and other
 * decision-making contexts throughout the RAPIDS tools framework.
 *
 * Conditions are type-parameterized to work with different target types (e.g.,
 * AutoTuner, ApplicationInfo, PlatformContext) and can be combined using
 * logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to create complex evaluation logic.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of object this condition evaluates against
 *
 * Example usage:
 * {{{
 *   class IsPlatformCondition(platform: String) extends ConditionTrait[AutoTuner] {
 *     override def eval(target: AutoTuner): Boolean = {
 *       target.platform.platformName == platform
 *     }
