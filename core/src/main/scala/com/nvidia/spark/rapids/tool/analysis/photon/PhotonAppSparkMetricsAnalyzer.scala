/**
 * Photon-specific implementation of AppSparkMetricsAnalyzer.
 *
 * This class extends AppSparkMetricsAnalyzer to handle Databricks Photon applications that
 * require special metric aggregation logic. In Photon, some metrics (peak memory and shuffle
 * write time) are calculated from accumulators instead of task metrics.
 *
 * Key differences from base class:
 * - Collects Photon-specific accumulators for peak memory and shuffle write time
 * - Uses AggAccumPhotonHelper instead of standard AggAccumHelper for metric aggregation
 * - Metrics are extracted from accumulators using Photon-specific metric labels
 *
 * @param app the Photon AppBase object to analyze

   * Approach:
   *   1. Collect accumulators for each metric type.
   *   2. For each stage, retrieve the relevant accumulators and calculate aggregated values.
   *
   * Note: A HashMap could be used instead of separate mutable.ArrayBuffer for each metric type,
   * but avoiding it for readability.
