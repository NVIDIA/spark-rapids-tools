/**
 * Abstract base class for implementing tuning rules in the RAPIDS auto-tuning system.
 *
 * This class provides a standard implementation of the TuningRuleTrait interface with
 * common functionality that most tuning rules need:
 * - Configuration management via TuningRuleConfig
 * - Application counting to track rule execution
 * - Default condition (always true) that can be overridden
 * - Post-apply hooks for cleanup or tracking
 *
 * Concrete implementations must:
 * 1. Extend this class
 * 2. Implement the `apply(tuner: AutoTuner)` method with optimization logic
 * 3. Optionally override `condition` to define when the rule should execute
 *
 * The rule execution lifecycle follows this pattern:
 * 1. `trigger` is called with an AutoTuner instance
 * 2. The `condition` is evaluated
 * 3. If true, `apply` is called to execute the optimization
 * 4. `postApply` is called for bookkeeping (increments application count)
 *
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   class MyTuningRule extends BaseTuningRule {
 *     override def apply(tuner: AutoTuner): Unit = {
 *       // Implement optimization logic here
 *     }
 *
 *     override def condition: ConditionTrait[AutoTuner] = {
 *       // Custom condition (optional)
 *       TuningCondPredicates.myCustomCondition
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
