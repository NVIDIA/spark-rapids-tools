/**
 * Manages the lifecycle and execution of tuning plugins for Spark RAPIDS AutoTuner.
 *
 * The TuningPluginManager is responsible for:
 * - Loading and initializing tuning plugins from configuration
 * - Activating plugins based on their activation conditions
 * - Managing tuning rules associated with each plugin
 * - Coordinating the application of tuning rules across all active plugins
 * - Controlling the execution order of rules (per-plugin or globally sorted)
 *
 * This class follows a lazy initialization pattern where plugins are only built and activated
 * when first accessed. It uses the builder pattern to construct plugins dynamically based on
 * the plugin configuration.
 *
 * ==Rule Execution Order==
 * The manager supports two modes for applying tuning rules:
 * 1. '''Cross-plugin sorting''' (sortRulesAcrossPlugins = true, default):
 *    All rules from all plugins are collected and sorted by priority globally.
 *    This ensures strict priority ordering regardless of plugin boundaries.
 *
 * 2. '''Per-plugin sorting''' (sortRulesAcrossPlugins = false):
 *    Rules are executed plugin-by-plugin in plugin priority order, with rules
 *    within each plugin sorted by their own priorities. This preserves plugin
 *    grouping and can be useful for maintaining logical separation.
 *
 * @param tunerInst The AutoTuner instance that this manager will operate on. This instance
 *                  is passed to all plugins and rules for accessing tuning context and
 *                  applying configuration changes.
 * @param sortRulesAcrossPlugins If true, rules from all plugins are sorted globally by priority.
 *                               If false, plugins are processed in order and rules within each
 *                               plugin are sorted by priority. Default is true.
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 *   val tuner = new AutoTuner(...)
 *
 *   // Default: rules sorted globally across all plugins
 *   val pluginManager = new TuningPluginManager(tuner, sortRulesAcrossPlugins = true)
 *   pluginManager.applyRules()
 *
 *   // Alternative: rules sorted per-plugin
 *   val perPluginManager = new TuningPluginManager(tuner, sortRulesAcrossPlugins = false)
 *   perPluginManager.applyRules()
 *
 *   // Get all tuning rules for inspection
 *   val rules = pluginManager.getTuningRulesSeq
 * }}}
 *
 * @see [[BaseTuningPlugin]] for plugin implementation details
 * @see [[TuningPluginsConfig]] for configuration structure
 * @see [[AutoTuner]] for the tuner instance this manager operates on
