/**
 * Trait defining the contract for tuning plugins in the RAPIDS auto-tuning system.
 *
 * A tuning plugin is a collection of related tuning rules that share a common activation
 * condition. Plugins provide a way to group and organize rules based on functionality,
 * hardware requirements, or platform-specific optimizations.
 *
 * Each plugin consists of:
 * - A collection of tuning rules that implement specific optimizations
 * - An activation condition that determines when the plugin should be enabled
 * - An optional fire method for plugin-level initialization or setup
 *
 * Plugins are typically loaded from configuration files and activated dynamically based
 * on the application context and hardware environment. Only plugins whose activation
 * conditions are satisfied will have their rules executed.
 *
 * The typical lifecycle of a plugin:
 * 1. Plugin is loaded and instantiated with its rules
 * 2. Activation condition is evaluated against the AutoTuner context
 * 3. If active, the `fire()` method is called for initialization
 * 4. Individual rules are executed in priority order
 *
 * Example implementation:
 * {{{
 *   class MyTuningPlugin extends TuningPluginTrait {
 *     override val activationCond: ConditionTrait[AutoTuner] = {
 *       new ConditionTrait[AutoTuner] {
 *         override def eval(tuner: AutoTuner): Boolean = {
 *           tuner.hasGPU && tuner.isDataprocPlatform
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     override def fire(): Unit = {
 *       // Optional plugin-level setup
 *       logInfo("Activating MyTuningPlugin")
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}

   *
   * Common activation conditions include:
   * - Platform-specific checks (e.g., Databricks, Dataproc, EMR)
   * - Hardware requirements (e.g., specific GPU types)
   * - Application characteristics (e.g., shuffle-heavy workloads)
