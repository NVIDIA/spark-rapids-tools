/**
 * Trait defining the contract for tuning rules in the RAPIDS auto-tuning system.
 *
 * A tuning rule encapsulates a specific optimization strategy that can be applied to
 * Spark applications to improve performance when running on GPU. Each rule consists of:
 * - A condition that determines when the rule should be triggered
 * - Logic to apply the optimization when triggered
 * - Priority to determine execution order relative to other rules
 *
 * Rules are executed in priority order (0 = highest, 100 = lowest), and only when their
 * associated conditions evaluate to true. The `trigger` method orchestrates the conditional
 * execution, while `apply` contains the actual optimization logic.
 *
 * Implementations of this trait are typically loaded dynamically from configuration files
 * and instantiated via reflection.
