# Defines the example target cluster information with tuningDefinitions support to be used by the Profiling Tool.
# Usage: `<JAVA CMD> --platform onprem --target-cluster-info <path to this file>`
#
# This example demonstrates how to use the "tuningDefinitions" feature to define custom Spark properties
# that will be merged with the default tuning table. For example, if a customer is using a customized Spark
# with legacy properties like "spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.minNumPostShufflePartitions", you can define it
# in tuningDefinitions and the AutoTuner will use it for recommendations.
