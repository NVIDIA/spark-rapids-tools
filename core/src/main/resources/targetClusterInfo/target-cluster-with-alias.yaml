# Defines the example target cluster information with alias support to be used by the Profiling Tool.
# Usage: `<JAVA CMD> --platform onprem --target-cluster-info <path to this file>`
#
# This example demonstrates how to use the "alias" feature to map non-standard Spark properties
# to standard ones. For example, if a customer is using a customized Spark with legacy properties
# like "spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.minNumPostShufflePartitions", you can map it to the standard
# property "spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.initialPartitionNum".
