              A list of semi-colon separated strings.
              Nested complex types are complex types that contain other complex types (i.e, array<struct<string,string>>).
              It can read all the schemas for DataSource V1.
              The Data Source V2 truncates the schema, so if you see “...”, then the full schema isn’t available. For
