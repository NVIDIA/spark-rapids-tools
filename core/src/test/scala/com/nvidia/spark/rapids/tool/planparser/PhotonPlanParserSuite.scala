   * Test that verifies Photon-specific operators are correctly parsed and converted to their
   * Spark CPU equivalents in the execution plan.
   *
   * This test:
   * 1. Loads an event log from a Databricks environment running with Photon enabled
   * 2. Parses all SQL plans in the application using SQLPlanParser
   * 3. Extracts all execution operators (ExecInfo) from the parsed plans
   * 4. For each Photon operator in the test cases:
   *    - Verifies the corresponding Spark operator name exists in the parsed results
   *    - Verifies the original Photon operator name does NOT appear in the results
   *
   * This ensures that:
   * - Photon operators are recognized and handled by the parser
   * - They are correctly converted to Spark-equivalent names for compatibility and analysis
   * - The conversion applies to regular operators (e.g., PhotonProject -> Project),
   *   Photon-specific parsers (e.g., PhotonBroadcastNestedLoopJoin -> BroadcastNestedLoopJoin),
   *   and cluster operators (e.g., PhotonShuffleMapStage -> WholeStageCodegen)
